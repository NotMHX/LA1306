# MiniLink (Frontend)
### Description
This is a small link directory site where you can view and search for links that are saved. We don't have a fully working backend, so you can't add new pages or delete existing ones. The sites are stored in a local JSON file instead. Feel free to edit that file.
### Tutorial
You can open the index.html file to open the website. Use the buttons and inputs to navigate.
